<h1> About Me</h1>
<p align="left">Hi, I am bugmenot.</p>
<img align="right" src="jan25.jpg" alt="image">
<p align="left"> I am a senior CIS major at Bemidji State University. My hobbies include things such as fishing, hunting, and video games. During the summer I enjoy taking my boat out on local lakes and fishing for Walleye and panfish. During the winter I enjoy making trips up to Red Lake and Lake of the Woods to fish.
</p>
<p align="left">I also spend a good chunk of my time playing Counter-Strike:Global Offensive. In years past I would play it competitivly on platforms such as ESEA or CEVO. The team was good enough to participate in their 'invite' leagues as opposed to their open registration league. However the teams were very short lived. Links to these profiles can be found below by clicking on their images. <br>

A current project I am working on is creating a listen server in python that recieves json loads from Official Valve Counter-Strike servers. It then parses the loads to extract relevant information and then saves it to a database for later use.
